# Lab2
 Web map made for GGR472 lab 2 
 It presents data on petstores downtown made on geojson.io 
 It also shows the locations of bike docking stations to help visualize how 
 convenient the pet stores are for people using a bike to get there 
 
 The pink dots represent the locations of pet stores and are replaced by the 
 name of the petstore when you zoom in closer to it 
 
 The basemap was adapted form a mapbox template
